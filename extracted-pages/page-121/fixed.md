Other students sought solace in the arts.

A number of former residential school

students went on to prominent careers

in the visual arts, including Alex Janvier,

Jackson Beardy, Judith Morgan, and Norval

Morrisseau. Some, such as Beardy, were

encouraged in their artistic endeavours by

sympathetic staff.505 Like sports, cultural

activities were underfunded. They were

also often intended to encourage assimi-

lation. In 1967, the students attending the

Shingwauk, Ontario, school put on a four-

scene's end, "The new ways show a way to work and live but the old ways have shown us

how to die." The performance was filmed and shown to the James Bay Cree, who refrained

from making any public comment, but were shocked to discover the degree to which their

children were being manipulated.506

Albert Canadien recalled in his memoirs from Akaitcho Hall:

A few of the boys had guitars and there were other instruments in the common room. Sometimes, a few of the boys would get together and play to pass the time. John, the boys' supervisor, noticed this was going on and took an interest, encouraging us to play and sing.

At first we got together just for fun. But eventually ... we formed a band. There were five or six of us, and we call ourselves the Arctic Ramblers. We had guitars, fiddle, bass guitar, drums, and there was even a piano for a while.

They played at dances at the residence and in Hay River.507 Canadien went on to play in the Chieftones, a rock-and-roll band that toured extensively across North America.508
On the rinks, the athletic fields, and parade grounds, or in the arts and handicraft rooms and on performance stages, many students found a way to express themselves, and, through that, gained the opportunity to explore their own talents and sometimes other parts of the country or the world. Most importantly, they gained some confidence in their ability to achieve.
