abusing students at the school. Joseph Jean Louis Comeau, Martin Houston, George Maczynski, and Paul Leroux all worked at Grollier Hall during this period. All were convicted of abusing Grollier Hall students.445 William Peniston Starr served as director of the Gordon's, Saskatchewan, residence from 1968 until 1984.446 Prior to that, he worked at a series of schools in Alberta and Québec.447 In 1993, he was convicted of ten counts of sexually assaulting Gordon's school students.448 Arthur Plint worked as a boys' supervisor at the Alberni residential school for two five-year periods between 1948 and 1968. In 1995, he pleaded guilty to eighteen counts of indecent assault. In sentencing him to eleven years in jail, Justice D. A. Hogarth described Plint as "a sexual terrorist."449
Physical abuse and sexual abuse often were intertwined. Jean Pierre Bellemare, who attended the Amos, Québec, school, spoke for many students when he told the Commission that he had been subjected to "physical violence, verbal violence, touchings, everything that comes with it."450 Andrew Yellowback was "sexually, physically, emotionally, and mentally abused" at the Cross Lake, Manitoba, school for eight years.451 There was no single pattern of abuse: students of both sexes reported assaults from staff members of both the opposite sex and the same sex as themselves.452
First-year students, traumatized by separation from their parents and the harsh and alien regime of the school, were particularly vulnerable to abusive staff members who sought to win their trust through what initially appeared to be simple kindness. In some cases, this might involve little more than extra treats from the school canteen. This favouritism, however, was often the prelude to a sexual assault that left the student scared and confused.453
Many students spoke of having been raped at school.454 These were moments of terror. Josephine Sutherland was cornered by one of the lay brothers in the Fort Albany school garage: "I couldn't call for help, I couldn't. And he did awful things to me."455 Other students recalled being assaulted in the church confessional.456 A student in the change room would suddenly have a bag pulled over his head.457 The abuse could begin with an instruction to report to the shower room in the middle of the night or to take lunch to a staff member's room.458 An abusive staff person might stalk a student, blocking her or his way, or grope a passing student.459 Female students spoke of how some staff members took advantage of their innocence, rubbing against them sexually while they were sitting on their laps.460 Abuse also took the form of voyeuristic humiliation: some staff insisted on watching the students shower.461
Some dormitory supervisors used their authority to institute dormitory-wide systems of abuse. Many students spoke of the fear and anxiety that spread across their dormitories in the evenings.462 They went to bed fearful that they might be called into the supervisor's room.463 To protect themselves, some students attempted to never be alone.464 Older children sometimes sought to protect younger ones.465
Most students came to school with little knowledge or understanding of sexual activity, let alone the types of sexual abuse to which they might be subjected. Abuse left them
