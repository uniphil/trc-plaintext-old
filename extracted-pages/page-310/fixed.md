304 · Truth & Reconciliation Commission
Lawyers besieged the archives. Archivists, caught between the vagaries of old informal recordkeeping practices in church schools across the country, legal demands for instant and full access and obligations to employer and profession, struggled to uphold their ideal of the honest stewardship of the records.... This process has tested the capacity of the archives and our professional ability to respond.151
These challenges did not end with the implementation of the 2007 Settlement Agreement. The trc's own difficulties in gaining access to government records held in lac demonstrated why state-controlled archives are not necessarily best suited to meet the needs of Survivors, their families, and communities.
By 2009, in terms of public education, lac had partnered with the Legacy of Hope Foundation and the Aboriginal Healing Foundation on two exhibitions: Where are the Children? Healing the Legacy of the Residential Schools; and "We were so far away ...": The Inuit experience of residential schools.152 Library and Archives Canada also produced an updated online version of the bibliography, "The Legacy of the Residential School System in Canada: A Selective Bibliography."153 In 2010, lac made an online finding aid available, "Conducting Research on Residential Schools: A Guide to the Records of the Indian and Inuit Affairs Program and Related Resources at Library and Archives Canada."154
In the spirit of reconciliation, lac archivists (along with church archivists) brought binders of residential school photographs to the Learning Places at the trc's National Events, where Survivors and others could see them and get copies of their class pictures and other school activities. For many Survivors, especially those who had no visual record of their own childhood or no pictures of siblings who have since passed away, this proved to be one of the most treasured aspects of the National Events experience. However, during this same time period, lac's holdings and its role in complying with the federal government's legal obligations for document production, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, became the focus of court proceedings between the trc and the federal government.
The TRC seeks full access to LAC records
Schedule N to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement describes the mandate of the trc as well as the obligations of the parties to the Agreement to assist the Commission in its work. There is a provision that deals with the obligation of the parties to provide relevant records to the Commission. It states:
In order to ensure the efficacy of the truth and reconciliation process, Canada and the churches will provide all relevant documents in their possession or control to and for the use of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, subject to the privacy interests of an individual as provided by applicable privacy legislation, and subject to and in compliance with applicable privacy and access to information legislation,
