close the schools and replace them with

day schools. However, the Indian Affairs

minister of the day, Frank Oliver, refused

to enact the plan without the support of

the churches involved. The plan foundered

for lack of Roman Catholic support. During

the same period, Bryce recommended that

the federal government take over all the

schools and turn them into sanatoria under

his control. This plan was rejected because

it was viewed as being too costly, and it was

thought that it would have met with church

opposition.366

Instead of closing schools or turning

them into sanatoria, the government's major response to the health crisis was the negotiation in 1910 of a contract between Indian Affairs and the churches. This con-

and imposed a set of standards for diet and

ventilation. The contract also required that students not be admitted "until, where practi-

cable, a physician has reported that the child is in good health."367

As noted earlier, although the contract led to improvements in the short term, inflation

quickly eroded the benefit of the increase in grants. The situation was worsened by the cuts

to the grants that were repeatedly imposed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The

underfunding created by the cuts guaranteed that students would be poorly fed, clothed,

and housed. As a result, children were highly susceptible to tuberculosis. And, because

the government was slow to put in place policies that would have prohibited the admis-

sion of children with tuberculosis, and ineffective in enforcing such policies once they

were developed, healthy children became infected. As late as the 1950s, at some schools,

pre-admission medical examinations appear to have been perfunctory, ineffective, or

non-existent.368 In the long run, the 1910 contract proved to be no solution for the tuber-

culosis crisis.

The schools often lacked adequate facilities for the treatment of sick children. In 1893,

Indian Affairs inspector T. P. Wadsworth reported that at the Qu'Appelle school, the "want

of an infirmary is still very much felt."369 Those infirmaries that existed were often prim-

itive. On an 1891 visit to the Battleford school, Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed con-

cluded that the hospital ward was in such poor shape that they had been obliged to move

the children in it to the staff sitting room. According to Reed, "The noise, as well as the bad

smells, come from the lavatory underneath."370 Proposals to construct a small hospital at
