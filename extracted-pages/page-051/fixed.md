Alberta, school. "They had a fence in the

playground. Nobody was allowed near the

fence. The boys played on this side, the

girls played on the other side. Nobody was

allowed to go to that fence there and talk to

the girls through the fence or whatever, you

The only reason Bernice Jacks had

wanted to go to residential school was to be

she discovered they were to sleep in sep-

him, you know. I said, `Yeah, but he's my brother.'"27

Taken from their homes, stripped of their belongings, and separated from their sib-

lings, residential school children lived in a world dominated by fear, loneliness, and lack

of affection.

William Herney, who attended the Shubenacadie school in Nova Scotia, recalled the

first few days in the school as being frightening and bewildering. "Within those few days,

you had to learn, because otherwise you're gonna get your head knocked off. Anyway, you

learned everything. You learned to obey. And one of the rules that you didn't break, you

obey, and you were scared, you were very scared."28 Raymond Cutknife recalled that when

he attended the Hobbema school in Alberta, he "lived with fear."29 Of his years in two dif-
