342 · Truth & Reconciliation Commission
Aboriginal programming and dedicated news coverage on Aboriginal issues, and to increase the number of Aboriginal people in staff and leadership positions. As of March 31, 2014, Aboriginal people made up 1.6% of the cbc workforce, well below the demographic makeup of Aboriginal people, who represent 4.3% of the total Canadian population.243
The Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (aptn), an independent, non-profit broadcaster, has taken a leadership role since the 1990s, in part to make up for the programming and scheduling limitations of cbc/Radio-Canada, to provide nationwide programming and news that reflects Aboriginal peoples' perspectives, concerns, and experiences. The aptn has provided an outlet for Aboriginal journalists, producers, directors, writers, artists, and musicians, and attracts a wide Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadian and international audience.244 As of 2014, over 75% of aptn employees were Aboriginal, and 28% of its programming was broadcast in various Aboriginal languages.245 In the Commission's view, the aptn is well positioned to provide media leadership to support the reconciliation process.
National public and private broadcasters must provide comprehensive and timely information and services to Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian public.
Calls to Action
84) We call upon the federal government to restore and increase funding to the cbc/RadioCanada, to enable Canada's national public broadcaster to support reconciliation, and be properly reflective of the diverse cultures, languages, and perspectives of Aboriginal peoples, including, but not limited to:
i. Increasing Aboriginal programming, including Aboriginal-language speakers.
ii. Increasing equitable access for Aboriginal peoples to jobs, leadership positions, and professional development opportunities within the organization.
iii. Continuing to provide dedicated news coverage and online public information resources on issues of concern to Aboriginal peoples and all Canadians, including the history and legacy of residential schools and the reconciliation process.
85) We call upon the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, as an independent non-profit broadcaster with programming by, for, and about Aboriginal peoples, to support reconciliation, including but not limited to:
i. Continuing to provide leadership in programming and organizational culture that reflects the diverse cultures, languages, and perspectives of Aboriginal peoples.
ii. Continuing to develop media initiatives that inform and educate the Canadian public, and connect Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.
