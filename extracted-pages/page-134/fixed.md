Cornelius, taught at the Regina school in the

early twentieth century.636 She left the fol-

lowing year, lured away to a better paying

school in the United States.637 In the early

1930s, the Brandon school hired former

student Lulu Ironstar as a teacher.638 But

these were exceptions, not the rule. As late

as 1960, there were only twenty-three First

Nations teachers working in residential

schools across the country. Nineteen taught

academic subjects and the other four taught

home economics and industrial arts.639 Stan

McKay, who was educated at the Birtle and

Brandon residential schools, taught in the

Norway House, Manitoba, school in the

1960s. Although there was much that he enjoyed about the work, he left after two years. In his opinion, the education he was

the lives of the children. There was, for example, a heavy emphasis on English, and no

recognition of the role of Cree in the communities from which the children came. "They

were doomed to fail under the system that existed. The majority of them would certainly

and did."640

Verna Kirkness, who was raised on the Fisher River First Nation in Manitoba, taught at

both the Birtle and Norway House schools.641 She did not like the atmosphere at the Birtle

school, where, she felt, administrators discouraged students from spending additional

time with her. In her memoir, she wrote that she "wondered if they were afraid the children

would tell me things about their lives away from the classroom."642

It was in the 1960s that a number of Aboriginal people were promoted to the position of

school principal. Ahab Spence, a former residential school student, was appointed princi-

pal of the Sioux Lookout school in 1963.643 Under Spence's administration, the school had

a staff of twenty-three, half of whom were Aboriginal.644 Colin Wasacase became the prin-

cipal of the Presbyterian school in Kenora in 1966.645 In keeping with past practice, his wife

was made school matron.646 This trend continued into the 1970s, when Aboriginal peo-

ple were appointed to administrative positions at numerous residential schools, includ-

ing those in Mission and Kamloops, British Columbia; Blue Quills, Alberta; Prince Albert,

Duck Lake, and Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan; and Fort George, Québec.647 Although the total

number of schools declined rapidly from 1969 onwards, they became a significant source

of Aboriginal employment, particularly in Saskatchewan, where six schools were operated
